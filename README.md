This application made interfaces easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. The interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems.

User will be able to do following:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

  * Update employee managers

  * Delete  employees



* Used the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Used [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Used [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

* Did a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment
